### Hi there, its great to have you here. ðŸ‘‹

I am Rohan Khurana, pursuing my Masters in Information Management at the Information School at University of Washington, Seattle and this is my GitHub profile.

### A little bit about me -
Hello! I Rohan Khurana, and I'm a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science degree in Information Management [University of Washington, Seattle](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/msim)  pursuing a specialisation in Data Science. Though in my opinion LinkedIn provides substantial info into someone's professional life, this website serves to provide a great insight into my professional experience, projects and my blog where I share my technical experience in articles and tutorials as well as random thoughts.

Prior to my pursuing my graduate degree in Seattle, I have received my Bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/)
